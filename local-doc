Two types of components in react :-
Function Based and Class Based.

Those components which are rendered by a function are called function based components.

State :-

It is a piece of data that you might need to save that might change in future. or for rendering or performing some function in future.

Changing a piece of state directly, doesnot change the rendering. for this we have to use setstate;

Object :-

Object in JS is a Key:Value Pair, ( very similar to dictionary )

Prop :-

Prop is a sort of data, that we can transfer, that we can send or that we can communicate from a parent component to child componenet.

For Child to parent Data transfer :- we use callback methods;
